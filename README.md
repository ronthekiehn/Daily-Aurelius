# Daily Aurelius


Chrome extension that shows a new quote from Marcus Aurelius's Meditations every day. Appears in the user's newtab as well as on the popup. Available soon on the chrome web store.

Thanks to [classics.mit.edu/Antoninus/meditations.html](https://classics.mit.edu/Antoninus/meditations.html) for the free version of Meditations. Extension is written in html, css and javascript. Also includes a quick python script I wrote that converted the text file from the website into a json file that the extension uses. 

## Features
Picks a random Marcus Aurelius quote. Quotes are weighted towards the short and snappy ones.
