# Daily-Aurelius
Chrome extension that shows a new quote from Marcus Aurelius's Meditations every day. 

Thanks to [classics.mit.edu/Antoninus/meditations.html](https://classics.mit.edu/Antoninus/meditations.html) for the free version of Meditations. Extension is written in javascript and html, and I wrote a quick python script that converted the text file from the website into an easily parsable json file that the extension uses.
